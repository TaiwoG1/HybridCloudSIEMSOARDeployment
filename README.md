<h1>Hybrid Cloud SIEM/SOAR Deployment & Threat Detection</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved architecting a comprehensive security operations environment using Microsoft Sentinel. The lab bridges the gap between cloud-native resources and on-premise assets by utilizing Azure Arc, implementing automated threat detection, and orchestrating incident response through SOAR playbooks. 
<br />
<br />
<h2>Key Activities & Skills Demonstrated:</h2>

- <b2> Infrastructure as Service: Deployed Log Analytics Workspaces (LAW) with custom retention policies and integrated them with Microsoft Sentinel.</b2>
- <b2> Hybrid Connectivity: Onboarded a non-Azure Windows 10 VM (VMware) into the Azure ecosystem using Azure Arc and the Connected Machine Agent.</b2>
- <b2> Detection Engineering: Configured Data Collection Rules (DCR) via AMA (Azure Monitor Agent) to ingest Windows Security Events and developed KQL queries for heartbeat monitoring. </b2>
- <b2> Threat Detection: Built custom analytics rule to hunt for potential threats, and perform actions based on the outcome, including generating alerts and incidents. </b2>
- <b2>SOAR Automation: Developed Logic App Playbooks and Automation Rules to streamline incident assignment and Entra ID integration.  </b2>
